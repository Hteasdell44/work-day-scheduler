# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
A simple calendar app for scheduling events throughout the hours of the workday. Using the DayJS library, the scheduler displays the current date at the top of the screen, and dynamically changes the color of each time block to indicate whether that time period is in the past, present, or future. User input is saved to local storage, so it will persist if the page is reloaded.
